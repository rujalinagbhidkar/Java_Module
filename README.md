## ☕ Java Module – CDAC DBDA Journey

This repository documents my learning and hands-on practice from the **Java module** of the CDAC DBDA course. It covers foundational and advanced concepts in object-oriented programming, multithreading, and data structures using Java.

### 📚 Key Concepts Covered
- **Class, Object, Constructor & Constructor Chaining**  
  Built the foundation of object-oriented design and learned how Java structures complex systems.
- **OOPs – The Four Pillars**  
  Mastered Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction to write scalable and maintainable code.
- **Menu-Driven Programs**  
  Developed interactive applications that respond to user input and simulate real-world logic.
- **Java Collections Framework**  
  Explored Lists, Sets, Maps, and their implementations for efficient data handling.
- **Multithreading**  
  Learned how to execute multiple tasks concurrently to improve application performance.

### 🙏 Acknowledgments
🔒 Huge thanks to **Manoj More**, **Shivnath Sir**, **Vineeta Singh**, **Nishad Kharote**, and **Prashant D. Bhosale** for their exceptional guidance, support, and knowledge sharing throughout the module. Your mentorship made complex topics approachable and engaging.

### 🚀 Looking Ahead
With Java now in my toolkit, I’m excited to apply these skills to real-world projects in **data science**, **backend development**, and **multithreaded systems** that demand performance and reliability.
